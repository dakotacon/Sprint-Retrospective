# Sprint-Retrospective

In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program conversations must be held with the user detailing what they expect the program to entail and how they intend it to function. User stories assist in this process by providing both developers and testers an interpretation of these requests allowing them to better suit the program to needs. In my approach to developing programs I should focus on providing useful and tangible results towards the completion of a program without adding unneccessary features. As for agile processes I hope to incorporate, I hope to utilize are those such as kanban which provide a better visulization of the current state of development. Finallly, I feel to be a good team member in software development, you must be open with others about your setbacks, limitations, and capabilities. With this I feel you should collaboritive and open to both receiving and giving help.
